Companies are looking for a variety of things when choosing where to build a new location. This process is extremely important since the location of a business can solely determine how well a business does. **This isn't the only factor but may be the most important**.

## Steps to Determine Location
There are a multitude of ways you can start to tackle this problem:
- Analyze already existing locations to see what works.
- Identifying your target audience.
- Collect data on how other brands can effect your sales.

This sort of analysis can give you crucial information about who your desired customers are (age, income level, *vibe*). It can also give you info on what made previous locations successful or not (store layout, location, building). With this you can make a more educated guess about what area your store will flourish in.

## Practical Applications
> Median income levels and other demographic factors are important, but donâ€™t fully capture the lifestyle nuances that explain why two people with the same demographics can have very different shopping behavior. Instead, you need to consider both demographic and psychographic factors to ensure a location is near the right types of consumers. (2)

## An Art and a Science
There is no way to ~~ensure~~ guarantee that your new location will do well. You will have to be vigilant and try to adapt. You might have to change the store layout or put out some different advertising campaigns to try and attract customers.
